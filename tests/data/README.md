# Test Data

This directory contains sample datasets used in tests for the FinAI toolkit.

- `sample_filing.txt`: A small excerpt of a 10-K or 10-Q filing used to test the filing parser.
- `sample_transcript.txt`: A sample earnings call transcript used to test the transcript loader.
- `prices.csv`: Daily OHLCV price data for a single ticker covering the date range of the sample filings and transcripts.

These files are placeholders. Developers should replace or augment them with minimal real-world data snippets suitable for unit tests. Keep datasets small to ensure tests remain fast.
