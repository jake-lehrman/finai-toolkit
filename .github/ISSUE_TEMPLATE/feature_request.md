## Summary

Please provide a short description of the feature you would like to see.  Explain what problem it solves or what new capability it introduces.

## Rationale

Why is this feature important?  Describe the impact on users and any context that is relevant (e.g. related research, missing capabilities in the current API).

## Proposed API / Implementation Details

Include any details you have about how this feature might be implemented.  For example, propose new module names, classes, functions, or configuration options.  If you have a high‑level design diagram or pseudocode, include it here.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Includes unit tests and, where appropriate, golden or property‑based tests.
- [ ] Updates documentation and usage examples.
- [ ] CI passes (lint, type, tests).

Thank you for taking the time to improve the FinAI Toolkit!  We encourage discussion and collaboration on GitHub to refine this proposal before implementation.
